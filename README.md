In this project, I analyzed financial budget data and election data provided in a .csv file to extract key metrics.
The code will output these metrics when run in both the terminal and in a separate .txt file located in the "analyis" folder in the respective project folders.

Financial Budget - PyBank
  
Election Data - PyPoll
